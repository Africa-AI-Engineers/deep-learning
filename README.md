# Deep Learning Bootcamp

The objective for the Deep Learning bootcamp is to ensure that the participants have enough theory and practical concepts of building a deep learning solution in the space of computer vision and natural language processing. Post the bootcamp, all the participants would be familiar with the following key concepts and would be able to apply them to a problem.

**Key Deep Learning Concept**
- **Theory**: DL Motivation, Back-propagation, Activation
- **Paradigms**: Supervised, Unsupervised
- **Models**: Architecture, Pre-trained Models (Transfer Learning)
- **Methods**: Perceptron, Convolution, Pooling, Dropouts, Recurrent, LSTM
- **Process**: Setup, Encoding, Training, Serving
- **Tools**: python-data-stack, keras, tensorflow
